**Project Description for WriteID**  

**WriteID - Handwriting Recognition System**  

**WriteID** is an AI-powered handwriting recognition system designed to compare handwritten samples and determine their similarity. The system utilizes **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques to analyze handwriting patterns, making it useful for **signature verification, document authentication, and forensic analysis**.  

---

 **📌 Project Overview**
The project consists of a **Flask-based backend** and a **frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Users can:  
✔️ Upload a reference handwriting sample  
✔️ Upload another handwritten text for comparison  
✔️ Receive a **match percentage** indicating the similarity  

Additionally, the system is trained using **custom datasets** to improve accuracy in handwriting matching.

 **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
 **Backend (Flask API)**  
- **Flask** – For handling API requests  
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – For image processing and handwriting analysis  
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations  
- **Flask-CORS** – To enable cross-origin requests  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – For handwriting model training  

 **Frontend**  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For UI/UX  
- **Cloudinary** – For image hosting  
- **JavaScript Fetch API** – For API communication  

 **Machine Learning (Handwriting Matching)**  
- **Preprocessing**: Image thresholding and feature extraction  
- **Model Training**: Deep learning model trained on **handwriting datasets**  
- **Verification**: Handwriting comparison using a similarity metric  

 **Tools & Deployment**  
- **GitHub** – Version control  
- **VS Code / PyCharm** – Development environment  
- **Postman** – API testing  
- **Virtual Environment (venv)** – Dependency management
